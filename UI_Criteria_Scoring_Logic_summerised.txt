Global Pages Evaluation

1. Navigation & Findability
Summary:The main menu and category links are alright—users can stumble around and find most sections—but the search bar is buried and breadcrumbs are mysterious.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Menu Clarity: Are primary categories labeled in plain language?
2. Search Visibility: Is the search input easy to spot without hunting?
3. Breadcrumbs/Orientation: Can users tell where they are and go “up” a level?
4. Link Consistency: Do labels stay the same across pages?
5. Hierarchy Logic: Does the structure match user expectations?
Score: 3/5
* What worked: Menu clarity (clear labels), link consistency.
* What failed: Search bar hidden in a secondary menu, missing breadcrumbs on product pages.
Example: The “Search” icon is stuck in a tiny hamburger menu—great, now users get a workout just to look for products.

2. Visual Design, Aesthetics & Layout
Summary:Clean fonts and generous whitespace earn points, but that pale gray CTA on white background practically begs to be ignored.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Typography: Readable sizes, consistent font choices.
2. Color Contrast: Sufficient contrast for text/buttons vs. background.
3. Spacing & Alignment: Even padding/margins and grid consistency.
4. Imagery Quality: Sharp, properly sized images.
5. Brand Cohesion: Colors and styles match the brand identity.
Score: 4/5
* What worked: Typography is crisp, spacing feels balanced, and brand colors are consistently applied.
* What failed: Primary CTA color lacks contrast—almost camouflaged.
Example: The “Add to Cart” button is light gray on white—perfect if your goal is to hide it.

Landing Page Evaluation

1. Visual Hierarchy & Focus
Summary:The hero banner grabs attention, but the below-the-fold promos fight for eyeballs—feels like three competing carousels.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Primary Focal Point: Is there one dominant element (hero, promo) above the fold?
2. Clutter Level: Are there too many competing visuals or messages?
3. Content Flow: Does the eye naturally move from top message → CTA → next section?
4. Whitespace Usage: Is there breathing room around key elements?
5. Consistency of Emphasis: Do font sizes/colors guide attention appropriately?
Score: 3/5
* What worked: Strong hero image and headline.
* What failed: Three simultaneous carousels below hero dilute focus; inconsistent heading sizes.
Example: Your eye hits the hero “Summer Sale” banner—then bounces between “New Arrivals,” “Best Sellers,” and “Editor’s Picks” carousels, all animating at once.

2. Primary CTA Effectiveness
Summary:“Shop Now” sits front and center, but it’s repeated elsewhere in a smaller, almost-hidden link style—confusing priorities.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Button Visibility: Is the main CTA button large and prominent?
2. Copy Clarity: Does the label clearly state the action/benefit?
3. Color Contrast: Does it stand out from the background?
4. Placement: Is it above the fold and near key messaging?
5. Action Hierarchy: Are secondary CTAs clearly less prominent?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: CTA copy “Shop Now – 50% Off” is tempting.
* What failed: Secondary “Explore More” link in footer-size font distracts and undermines the main button’s priority.
Example: You have a giant “Shop Now” button—but right below it, a tiny “Browse Collections” link that looks more like a caption than a choice.

3. Product Discovery & Category Highlights
Summary:Top categories show up as five tiny icons at the bottom of the hero—users may never scroll that far. No featured products to spark interest.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Visibility of Categories: Are key categories front-and-center?
2. Icon/Imagery Size: Are the category images large enough to notice?
3. Context & Labeling: Do icons clearly communicate category meaning?
4. Featured Products Section: Is there a “New Arrivals” or “Trending” showcase?
5. Call-to-Action for Each Highlight: Are there clear “View” or “Shop” links?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: Icon labels are descriptive (“Women,” “Men,” “Kids,” etc.).
* What failed: Icons are in a small row below the fold; no featured product grid to entice.
Example: A user might never discover “Electronics” because its icon is hidden under the main banner—no “Featured Gadgets” section to lure them in.


Search-Results Page Evaluation

1. Listing Content & Information Density
Summary:Product cards display image and price—but critical info like ratings, stock status, and color swatches are MIA. Scanning dozens of items quickly becomes guesswork.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Image Visibility: Is there a clear, well-sized thumbnail?
2. Price Display: Is the current price (and sale price if any) shown prominently?
3. Ratings & Reviews: Are star ratings and review counts visible?
4. Variant Indicators: Are available colors/sizes hinted?
5. Stock or Promotion Badges: Are “Out of Stock,” “New,” or “Sale” badges present?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: Thumbnails are crisp; prices are shown under each image.
* What failed: No ratings or review counts; no indication if an item is on sale or out of stock; users can’t tell at a glance if a product meets their criteria.
Example: You see a nice jacket for $80—but you have zero clue if it has good reviews or comes in your size until you click.

2. Filtering & Sorting Functionality
Summary:Filters live in a sidebar but require a “Apply” click and full page reload. Sorting dropdown defaults to “Relevance” with no labels indicating what that means.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Filter Relevance: Do the facets match the product type (e.g., size, color for apparel)?
2. Multi-Select & Counts: Can users pick multiple filters? Are result counts shown per option?
3. Instant Feedback: Do filters/sorts apply immediately or force a full reload?
4. Sort Options: Are intuitive choices provided (price, rating, newest)?
5. UI Accessibility: Is the filter panel easy to open/close on mobile?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: Sidebar lists relevant facets (brand, price range).
* What failed: No live updating—users must hit “Apply Filters” and wait; sort options are confusingly labeled (“Best Match” vs “Popularity” vs “Top Rated” with zero context).
Example: You tick “Black” and “Size M,” click “Apply,” and stare at a loading spinner—could’ve lost interest by then.

Product Page Evaluation

1. Product Info & Description Quality
Summary:The product description tells you it’s a “luxury leather handbag” but omits dimensions, materials origin, and care instructions—guesswork level: expert.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Completeness: Are all key specs present (size, material, weight, etc.)?
2. Clarity: Is the copy jargon-free and easy to scan (bullets, headings)?
3. Organization: Is there a logical structure (overview → details → FAQs)?
4. Depth: Does it anticipate common questions (care, warranty, use cases)?
5. Brevity: Is it concise enough to read quickly?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: You get a decent overview (“handcrafted Italian leather”).
* What failed: No measurements, no “how to clean,” no warranty details—leaves you Googling “What is pebble grain leather?”
Example: “Luxury leather handbag” is intriguing—until you realize you have zero clue how big it actually is or if it’ll survive your rain-soaked commute.

2. Product Imagery & Media
Summary:Five identical shots of the bag lying flat. No zoom, no model shot, no context—like staring at a leather pancake.
Scoring Criteria:
1. Variety: Are there multiple angles and in-use/context shots?
2. Quality: Are images high-res and sharp at full size?
3. Zoom Functionality: Can you enlarge or hover-zoom to see texture?
4. Media Diversity: Are there videos/360° views or just static photos?
5. Contextual Use: Do any images show the product in real-world scenarios?
Score: 1/5
* What worked: Images are at least in focus.
* What failed: All five look the same—flat on white, no zoom, no lifestyle shot—zero help imagining it in your arm.
Example: You try to zoom, and the site just refreshes the same tiny photo—brilliant way to hide scuffs.

3. Product Card: Pricing, Availability, CTA & Cross-Selling
Summary:Price is there but no “on sale” badge. “Add to Cart” is greyed out until you guess the SKU. Related items are random desk lamps—because why not?
Scoring Criteria:
1. Price Transparency: Is the current price and any discount clearly shown?
2. Stock Status: Is availability (in-stock, low stock, preorder) obvious?
3. CTA Usability: Is “Add to Cart” prominent, enabled at the right time, and labeled well?
4. Variant Selection: Are size/color choices intuitive and error-proof?
5. Cross-Selling: Are related or complementary products shown and relevant?
Score: 2/5
* What worked: The price is unambiguously listed under the title.
* What failed: Button disabled until you pick a “Style Code” nobody warned you about; “You might also like” shows bedside lamps instead of wallet or keychain.
Example: You finally pick “Style Code: BLK-01” just to see the grey button turn active—only to be offered a lamp as a “matching accessory.”

There. Your product page verdict, complete with scorings and brutal examples.
